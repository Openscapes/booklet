We've built this booklet collaboratively with Quarto and GitHub. This is a workflow that's super powerful for research â€” that's where we first learned it too. This booklet is a low-stakes way to practice the Quarto-GitHub workflow if that's something you're interested in. 

In GitHub terminology, "forking" means making a copy that's still connected to the original (so that you can send updates back and forth). To do this, follow the steps involved in our tutorial: [Making shareable documents with Quarto](https://openscapes.github.io/quarto-website-tutorial/). Specifically, first you'll [fork to your GitHub account](https://openscapes.github.io/quarto-website-tutorial/explore.html#fork-to-your-account). Then, you'll be able to [edit from the browser](https://openscapes.github.io/quarto-website-tutorial/quarto-workflows/browser.html) or follow the instructions to work locally.

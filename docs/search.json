What feels good, what feels clunky? Are there things you find yourself repeating a lot (copy-pasting, clicking?) What does a typical day or week look like? What software do you use, and for what purposes? How do you connect pieces together (saving screenshots to send via email?) How do you document your process; how do you come back to something after a week, a month, a year? How do you interact with colleagues? Who do you share your workflow with? Who would you like to share this with? Push back against the \"I work alone\" response: who do you talk to, who influences your work, how do you give and receive feedback"

    "text": "Welcome\nHello! This is the open booklet for the Openscapes Reflections Program, an open data science coaching program for researchers and those who support research.\nOver the last five years Openscapes has helped hundreds of researchers improve their work life through open and kinder science. We also know many like you have been looking for a lighter-weight way to get involved to support yourself as well as your colleagues. We’ve designed the Reflections Program to meet this need and be more affordable and accessible; a welcoming place to reflect and grow the open science movement. Reflections is a 3-week program modeled from leadership coaching, something now core to the Openscapes approach. We look forward to learning together with you on this journey in the first iteration of this program."

    "text": "Reflecting together\nThe motivation for Openscapes Reflections is to provide a space to reflect on your workflows and plan how open data science practices can improve your daily habits and fuel institutional culture change.\nThe Reflections Program is set up to be an affordable, self-paced way to learn and incorporate open data science principles into your workflow, no matter where you are starting from. Through weekly prompts and community huddles, we will reflect together through a process that leaves you feeling empowered and intentional about your work and how you can get it done. We’re hoping this is something that could be valuable for you year after year, both for reflecting yourself and onboarding your team. We designed this to complement to our ongoing initiatives, particularly the Openscapes Champions Program, so here you can explore your workflows in a self-driven manner aligned with the Pathway document."

Every week there will be new prompts and opportunities to focus together and on your own time.\n\nTuesdays: Reflection prompts are emailed\nThursdays: Optional Huddle via Zoom with the Openscapes team and the community\nFridays: Huddle recording available online for your review\n\nAt Openscapes, we reflect, reimagine, and make our goals actionable incrementally through our daily work. Each week we spend together will help you do this too. Here is how we hope you’ll feel after each week:\nWeek 1. Reflect - I have reflected how I work and noticed what feels good and what feels stuck.\nWeek 2. Imagine - I have seen more of what’s possible with open data science and how my peers work and can see myself incorporating this too.\nWeek 3. Set Goals - I am empowered by what’s possible and have a starting plan and community to weave this into my ongoing work, and know I am not alone."

    "text": "What to expect\nNo judgement, just support and community! We know from experience it is intimidating to change how you work, and this process takes time. Through Reflections we will focus on this journey together.\nEach week you’ll reflect to the prompts in this booklet, and have the opportunity to join a Huddle to reflect in the company of like-minded folks, ask your questions, and share your experiences. This is how we all learn together, reimagine our work, and drive culture change.\nYou may be asking yourself what to “reflect” on during this period and where to start. More often than not, when prompted we can identify what we need, but we don’t give ourselves the space in our lives to do so. Further, the open data science landscape has completely changed how we can do and share our research, and few of us have had the opportunity to learn where to learn the skills required to engage. The Reflections program is an opportunity to ask what works for me, where am I stuck? What would improve my work? What will I do next? We’ll answer these questions together in a space where we each make a plan to improve how we work and support culture change more broadly.\n\nIs this for me?\nYes! We welcome anyone and everyone. If you’re sensing you could improve your daily life by rethinking parts of your workflows, this program is for you. You don’t need to know where to start; this program gives you that space and guidance.\nIncorporating open practices into your workflow benefits not only you, but those who you work with and the community you share your work with as well. While we are motivated by climate change and social justice, this program is not limited to a certain degree level, discipline, or area of expertise. You can be early in your career a member of senior leadership, or anywhere in between. You can be an ecologist, an immunologist, or in a communications field, or figuring out what you want to be! We’re excited to meet you and continue the conversations.\nAdditionally, you don’t have to work with data or code! We see open science as a movement rooted in creating a more inclusive, collaborative, and kinder future for our planet and society. This movement is being built with folks just like yourself bringing these principles to your work in whichever way you do it."

    "text": "About\n\nOpenscapes\nOpenscapes is an approach for doing better science in less time. We help research groups reimagine data analysis, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities. Openscapes’ mentorship and community engagement approaches center on open data science as kinder science, enabling increased efficiency and resilience for teams so that their work has more enduring impact.\n\n\nOur team\nJulie Lowndes and Ileana Fenwick are designing and leading the Reflections Program. We are super grateful to Erin Robinson for introducing us to coaching as a skill for open data science and having the initial idea for the Reflections program. We’re also grateful for many formative conversations with Liz Neeley, and to Stefanie Butland for helping support all Openscapes programs and communities!\n\n\n\n\n\nHi! I’m Ileana, a core member of the Openscapes team. I learned about open data science as a first year PhD student and these tools have transformed how I do my work. Going from never hearing about open science before to implementing these strategies and tools is challenging! We don’t expect you to do it all in these next few weeks. This is a space to study your own habits and workflow so we can use open science tools successfully as you already are!\nHi! I’m Julie, founder and director of Openscapes. Since I first felt empowered by the open science community I’ve made it a priority to welcome and support as many others as possible. I have learned how to experiment and incorporate the new things I learn into my daily work, whether that is in writing, code, facilitation, or other skills relevant to open science, climate, and social justice movements. I’m excited to have this time to reflect with you!\n\n\n\nThis Booklet\nThe Booklet is written as an open educational resource to reuse and remix. This open curriculum is improved iteratively and the most recent version always available online for reuse and remix. Each (upcoming) chapter in the Reflections Booklet introduces prompts to guide your reflections.\nAnd also, awesomely, it’s created with the same tools and practices we use in analyses: R/RStudio - R Markdown and Quarto - and GitHub.\n\n\nCitation\nAll material in the Openscapes Reflections Booklet is available under a CC-BY 4.0 licence.\nPlease cite this guide as:\nThe Openscapes Core Team, Lowndes & Fenwick (2023).

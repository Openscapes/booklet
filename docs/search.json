    "text": "Welcome\nHello! This is the open booklet for the Openscapes Reflections Program, an open data science coaching program for researchers and those who support research.\nOver the last five years Openscapes has helped hundreds of researchers improve their work life through open and kinder science, largely through Openscapes Champions, a 10-week mentorship program for science teams. We know many like you have been looking for a lighter-weight way to get involved or continue building habits to support yourself and your colleagues. We’ve designed the Reflections Program to meet this need and be more accessible and affordable; a welcoming place to reflect and grow the open science movement. Reflections is a 3-week program modeled from leadership coaching, something now core to the Openscapes approach. We look forward to learning together with you on this journey in the first iteration of this program."

    "text": "Reflecting together\nOpenscapes Reflections provides a space to reflect on your workflows and plan how open data science practices can improve your daily habits and fuel institutional culture change. This can mean moving away from workflows with folders full of files with names like “analysis_final_2b.xlsx” and redirecting that energy to the parts of your work you really care about.\nThrough weekly prompts and community huddles, we will reflect together through a process that leaves you feeling empowered and intentional about your work and how you can get it done. It is a self-paced program to improve your daily workflow, no matter where you are starting from. We’re hoping this is something that will be valuable for you year after year, both for reflecting yourself and onboarding your team."

Every week there will be new prompts and opportunities to focus together and on your own time.\n\nTuesdays: Reflection prompts are emailed\nThursdays: Optional Huddle via Zoom with the Openscapes team and the Reflections community\nFridays: Huddle recording available online for your review\n\nAt Openscapes, we reflect, reimagine, and make our goals actionable incrementally through our daily work. Each week we spend together will help you do this too. Here is how we hope you’ll feel after each week:\nWeek 1. Reflect - I have reflected how I work and noticed what feels good and what feels stuck.\nWeek 2. Imagine - I have seen more of what’s possible with open data science and how my peers work and can see myself incorporating this too.\nWeek 3. Set Goals - I am empowered by what’s possible and have a starting plan and community to weave this into my ongoing work, and I know I am not alone."

    "text": "What to expect\nNo judgement, just support and community! We know from experience it is intimidating to change how you work, and this process takes time and small steps. Through Reflections we will focus on this journey together.\nEach week you’ll reflect on the prompts in this booklet, and have the opportunity to join a Huddle to reflect in the company of like-minded folks, ask your questions, and share your experiences. This is how we all learn together, reimagine our work, and drive culture change.\nYou may be asking yourself what to “reflect” on during this period and where to start. More often than not, when prompted we can identify what we need, but we don’t give ourselves the space in our lives to do so. Further, the open data science landscape has completely changed how we can do and share our research, and few of us have had the opportunity to find where to learn the skills required to engage. The Reflections program is a space to ask, What works for me? Where am I stuck? What would improve my work? What will I do next? We’ll answer these questions together in a space where we each make a plan to improve how we work and support culture change more broadly.\n\nIs this for me?\nWe think so! This program is for you if:\n\nyou’re sensing you could improve your daily life by rethinking parts of your workflows\nyou’re looking for accountability and space\nyou’re open to trying new things\n\nReflections does not require any experience with data, code, or open science. We designed it for people across career stages, disciplines, and areas of expertise.\nWe see open science as a movement rooted in creating a more inclusive, collaborative, and kinder future for our planet and society. This movement is being built with folks just like yourself bringing these principles to your work in whichever way you do it. Wherever you are now is the right place; this program gives you that space and guidance to figure out where to start. We’re excited to meet you and begin the conversations."

We intend to make this program accessible to anyone interested: sponsorship available through the form.\nRegistration includes 3 weekly reflection prompts and 3 live Huddles with our team and the community via Zoom. These calls will be recorded and uploaded online so that you’re able to watch them on your own time if you can’t attend live.\nAll reflection prompts will be openly available through this Booklet, and yes, you can do the Reflections program for free on your own or with colleagues (as is true with all Openscapes resources!).

    "text": "About\n\nOpenscapes\nOpenscapes is an approach for doing better science in less time. We help research groups reimagine data analysis, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities. Openscapes’ mentorship and community engagement approaches center on open data science as kinder science, enabling increased efficiency and resilience for teams so that their work has more enduring impact.\n\n\nOur team\nJulie Lowndes and Ileana Fenwick are designing and leading the Reflections Program. We are super grateful to Erin Robinson for introducing us to coaching as a skill for open data science and having the initial idea for the Reflections program. We’re also grateful for many formative conversations with Liz Neeley, and to Stefanie Butland for helping support all Openscapes programs and communities!\n\n\n\nIleana Fenwick and Julie Lowndes at the 2022 RStudio conference\n\n\nHi! I’m Ileana, a core member of the Openscapes team. I learned about open data science as a first year PhD student and these tools have transformed how I do my work. Going from never hearing about open science before to implementing these strategies and tools is challenging! We don’t expect you to do it all in these next few weeks. This is a space to study your own habits and workflows so we can improve incrementally and help each other.\nHi! I’m Julie, founder and director of Openscapes. Since I first felt empowered by the open science community I’ve made it a priority to welcome and support as many others as possible. I have learned how to experiment and incorporate the new things I learn into my daily work, whether that is in writing, code, facilitation, or other skills relevant to open science, climate, and social justice movements. I’m excited to have this time to reflect with you!\n\n\n\nThis Booklet\nThe Booklet is written as an open educational resource to reuse and remix. This open curriculum is improved iteratively and the most recent version is always available online. Each (upcoming) chapter in the Reflections Booklet introduces prompts to guide your reflections.\nAnd also, awesomely, it’s created with the same tools and practices we use in analyses: R/RStudio - R Markdown and Quarto - and GitHub.\n\n\nCitation\nAll material in the Openscapes Reflections Booklet is available under a CC-BY 4.0 licence.\nPlease cite this guide as:\nThe Openscapes Core Team, Lowndes & Fenwick (2023).

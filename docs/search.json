    "text": "Welcome\nHello! This is a 3-week program, modeled after leadership coaching, that provides structure and accountability for participants to reflect and plan. This reflection and planning focuses on analytical and reporting workflows, and how open data science tools, practices, and communities can improve daily habits and fuel institutional culture change.\nHoliday Council is our end-of-year program that gives you a chance to reconnect to your dreams + recommit to your goals. It’s a three week goal-setting course for smart + soulful women done in community. Through a mash-up of calls, deep prompts, gorgeous worksheets, visioning meditations, and flexible action planning — I walk you through a process that’s… A little bit practical, a little bit magical + a whole lot of useful.\nThe Holiday Council is set up to be affordable way to get and stay involved in Stratejoy — we look forward to welcoming you back, year after year. We’ve been doing the Holiday Council for eleven years now and it’s incredible to see it becoming a treasured December tradition for so many. We know the Champions program has had impact and we want it to be more accessible and bite-sized\nOur 21 days together in December will take you from feeling like life is moving at warp speed to understanding exactly where you’ve been and exactly what you want from the year ahead.\nNo judgement, just support and celebration. No bullshit, just a bevy of other like-minded women. No gurus, just a leader who’s been guiding women through this process for 11 magical years and loving every minute of it!"

    "text": "Reflecting together\nWelcome! I’m Ileana a member of the Reflections team who will be here with you as you navigate our programming for the next 3 weeks. I learned about Openscapes as a first year PhD student and have seen open science toold transform how I do my work. Going from never hearing about open science before to implementing these strategies and tools is challenging! We don’t expect you to do it all in these next few weeks. This is a space to study your own habits and workflow so we can use open science tools successfully as you already are!\nPICTURE\nSo you may be asking yourself what to “reflect” on during this period and where to start. Over the years Openscapes has helped hundreds of researchers improve how they work and we’re here to do the same for you. More often than not we have the answers inside of us, but we aren’t given the space and time in our lives to uncover and implement what we know can be helpful. The Reflections program is an opportunity to look inward, what works FOR ME? How do I want to share my research? What skills would improve my work? To answer these questions and more in a space where we make a plan together to improve how and when our work gets done.\nWe’re excited to meet you and continue the conversations"

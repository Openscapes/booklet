# Welcome {.unnumbered}

Hello! This is a 3-week program, modeled after leadership coaching, that provides structure and accountability for participants to reflect and plan. This reflection and planning focuses on analytical and reporting workflows, and how open data science tools, practices, and communities can improve daily habits and fuel institutional culture change.

Through a series of reflective prompts, community check ins, and practical goal setting modules we walk you through a process that leaves you feeling empowered and intentional about your work and how you can get it done. Reflections is our self driven program that gives you a chance to establish your needs, learn new approaches and confidently pursue your way forward into open science. We look forward to taking this journey together.

The Holiday Council is set up to be affordable way to get and stay involved in Stratejoy — we look forward to welcoming you back, year after year. We’ve been doing the Holiday Council for eleven years now and it’s incredible to see it becoming a treasured December tradition for so many. **We know the Champions program has had impact and we want it to be more accessible and bite-sized**

Our 21 days together in December will take you from feeling like life is moving at warp speed  to understanding exactly where you’ve been and exactly what you want from the year ahead.

No judgement, just support and celebration. No bullshit, just a bevy of other like-minded women. No gurus, just a leader who’s been guiding women through this process for 11 magical years and loving every minute of it!


## Reflecting together

Welcome! I'm Ileana a member of the Reflections team who will be here with you as you navigate our programming for the next 3 weeks. I learned about Openscapes as a first year PhD student and have seen open science toold transform how I do my work. Going from never hearing about open science before to implementing these strategies and tools is challenging! We don't expect you to do it all in these next few weeks. This is a space to study your own habits and workflow so we can use open science tools successfully as you already are!

So you may be asking yourself what to "reflect" on during this period and where to start. Over the years Openscapes has helped hundreds of researchers improve how they work and we're here to do the same for you. More often than not we have the answers inside of us, but we aren't given the space and time in our lives to uncover and implement what we know can be helpful. The Reflections program is an opportunity to look inward, what works FOR ME? How do I want to share my research? What skills would improve my work? To answer these questions and more in a space where we make a plan together to improve how and when our work gets done.

We're excited to meet you and continue the conversations

# Welcome {.unnumbered}

Hello! This is the open booklet for the **Openscapes Reflections Program, an open data science coaching program for researchers and those who support research**.

Over the last five years Openscapes has helped hundreds of researchers improve their work life, largely through the [Champions Program](https://openscapes.org/champions). We also know many like you have been looking for a lighter-weight way to get involved to support yourself and your colleagues as well. We've designed the Reflections Program to meet this need and be more affordable and accessible. It is a 3-week program modeled after leadership coaching, which has become core to the Openscapes approach. We look forward to learning together with you on this journey.

At [Openscapes](https://openscapes.org), we think about open science like a landscape, and we help researchers move from lonely science towards collaborative science as they identify their common needs and start navigating the landscape wherever they are starting from.

This open curriculum is improved iteratively and the most recent version always available online for reuse and remix. Each (upcoming) chapter in the Reflections Booklet introduces prompts to guide your reflections.

## Reflecting together

Openscapes Reflections is an open data science coaching program for researchers and those who support research. It is a 3-week program that gives you a space and community to reflect on your workflows and plan how open data science tools, practices, and communities can improve daily habits and fuel institutional culture change.

Reflections is set up to be an affordable, self-paced way to learn and incorporate open data science principles into your workflow, no matter where you are starting from. Through weekly prompts and community huddles, we will reflect together through a process that leaves you feeling empowered and intentional about your work and how you can get it done. We're hoping this is something that could be valuable for you year after year, whether that is reflecting yourself or onboarding your team. We see this as a complement to the Champions Program, where you can explore your workflows in a self-driven similar to the Pathway document.

Great language but redundant (for now - save for other uses)

We know the Champions program has improved the lives of hundreds of researchers to date, and we want it to be more accessible and bite-sized.

establish your needs, learn new approaches, and confidently pursue your way forward into open science. for you

## Program schedule

Reflections will run from **May 8-26 2023**. Every week there will be new prompts and opportunities to focus together and on your own time.

-   **Tuesdays**: Reflection prompts are emailed
-   **Thursdays**: Optional Huddle via Zoom with Ileana, Julie, and the community
-   **Fridays**: Huddle recording available online for your review

At Openscapes, we reflect, reimagine, and make our goals actionable incrementally through our daily work. Each week we spend together will help you do this too. Here is how we hope you'll feel after each week:

**Week 1.  Reflect**  - I have reflected how I work and noticed what feels good and what feels stuck.  

**Week 2.  Imagine** - I have seen more of what's possible with open data science and how my peers work and can see myself incorporating this too.  

**Week 3.  Set Goals** - I am empowered by what's possible and have a starting plan and community to weave this into my ongoing work, and know I am not alone.

<!-- 

The minimum expected time commitment is 1hr/week for 3 weeks.

## Registration & what to expect

**Registration** is \$95 and provides weekly Reflection Prompts and 3 Live Zoom Calls we call "Huddles" with Ileana & Julie. These calls will be recorded and shared with the Reflections community so that you're able to watch them on your own time if you can't attend live.

All prompts will be openly available through this Booklet, so yes, you can do the Reflections program on your own or with your research group (as is true with all Openscapes resources!). By registrating we provide structure, accountability, and community.

**What to expect** - no judgement, just support and community! We know it can be intimidating to change the way you've been doing your work, and we acknowledge this process takes time. Through Reflections we will start this journey together.

You may be asking yourself what to "reflect" on during this period and where to start. More often than not, when prompted we can identify what we need, but we don't give ourselves the space in our lives to do so. Further, the open data science landscape has completely changed how we can do and share our research, and few of us have had the opportunity to learn where to learn the skills required to engage. The Reflections program is an opportunity to ask what works for me, where am I stuck? What would improve my work? What will I do next? We'll answer these questions together in a space where we each make a plan to improve how we work and support culture change more broadly.


## Our team

Julie Lowndes and Ileana Fenwick are designing and leading the Reflections Program this year. We are so grateful to Erin Robinson for introducing us to coaching as a skill for open data science and having the initial idea for the Reflections program. We're also grateful for many formative conversations with Liz Neeley. And thank you to Stefanie Butland for helping support all Openscapes programs and communities!

Hi! I'm Ileana, a core member of the Openscapes team who will be here with you as you navigate our programming for the next 3 weeks. I learned about open data science as a first year PhD student and these tools have transformed how I do my work. Going from never hearing about open science before to implementing these strategies and tools is challenging! We don't expect you to do it all in these next few weeks. This is a space to study your own habits and workflow so we can use open science tools successfully as you already are!

Hi! I'm Julie ...

## Is this for me?

Yes! We welcome anyone and everyone. If you're sensing you could improve your daily life by rethinking parts of your workflows, this program is for you. You don't need to know where to start; this program gives you that space and guidance.

Incorporating open practices into your workflow benefits not only you, but those who you work with and the community you share your work with as well. This process is not limited to a certain degree level, discipline, or area of expertise. You can be early in your career a member of senior leadership, or anywhere in between. You can be an ecologist, an immunologist, or in a communications field, or elsewhere! We're excited to meet you and continue the conversations.

Additionally, you don't have to work with data or code! We see open science as a movement rooted in creating a more inclusive, collaborative, and kinder future for our planet and society. This movement is being built with folks just like yourself bringing these principles to your work in whichever way you do it.

title: "Reflections: You and your workflow"

**You** - What are things you know about yourself (I write best in the mornings, I am comfortable speaking up in new spaces)? What is something you learned recently? What is something you learned about yourself recently? Think about something you enjoy doing. What do you enjoy about it? What qualities about yourself do you see coming through? What are your values? Where do you go to get help?

**Workflow** - Jot down thoughts about your workflow. What feels good, what feels clunky? Are there things you find yourself repeating a lot (copy-pasting, clicking?) What does a typical day or week look like? What software do you use, and for what purposes? How do you connect pieces together (saving screenshots to send via email?) How do you document your process; how do you come back to something after a week, a month, a year? How do you interact with colleagues? Who do you share your workflow with? Who would you like to share this with? Push back against the \"I work alone\" response: who do you talk to, who influences your work, how do you give and receive feedback
